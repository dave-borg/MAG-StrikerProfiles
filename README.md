The User Management Service is a critical component of a microservices architecture, especially for systems that require user authentication, authorization, profile management, and the handling of user-specific data and roles. In the context of the MAG flying club's booking system, this service would be tailored to accommodate the specific needs of the club, including pilots, check pilots, and administrative staff. Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionalities, design considerations, and implementation aspects:

### Core Functionalities

1. **User Registration and Management**:
   - Facilitates user sign-up processes, including the collection of essential information like name, email, and role (e.g., member, admin, check pilot).
   - Provides CRUD operations for user profiles, allowing for updating of user details, role changes, and account deactivation or deletion.

2. **Authentication**:
   - Manages user login processes, supporting secure authentication mechanisms like username/password, OAuth, or JWT tokens.
   - Ensures secure handling of user credentials and implements mechanisms for password recovery and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.

3. **Authorization**:
   - Defines and manages roles and permissions, ensuring users can only access features and data appropriate to their role (e.g., admins can manage aircraft and users, while members can book flights).
   - Supports role-based access control (RBAC) and, if necessary, more granular access control models.

4. **Pilot Certification Tracking**:
   - Keeps track of pilot-specific information, such as medical certificates, license details, and proficiency check records, including expiration dates.
   - Integrates with the Proficiency Check Management Service to verify and update pilot status based on recent checks.

5. **Notification Preferences**:
   - Manages user preferences for receiving notifications, allowing users to opt-in or out of different types of communications.

### Design Considerations

- **Scalability**: Design the service to handle a growing number of users and requests efficiently, considering database performance, caching strategies, and service replication.

- **Security**: Implement best practices for data security, including encrypted storage of sensitive information, secure API access, and regular security audits to protect against vulnerabilities.

- **Data Isolation**: Ensure that user data is appropriately isolated and accessible only by authorized services or components, especially sensitive information like medical certificates and license details.

- **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant legal and regulatory requirements regarding personal data protection (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) by implementing features for data consent, access, rectification, and erasure.

### Implementation Aspects

- **Technology Stack**: Typically implemented using Spring Boot for its extensive support for REST APIs, security, data access, and cloud-native features. Spring Security can be used for authentication and authorization features.

- **Database Design**: Utilize a relational database for structured user data and roles (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) with considerations for schema design that supports easy querying and scalability.

- **API Design**: Design RESTful APIs following best practices, ensuring endpoints are logically organized, secure, and provide clear feedback for success and error states.

- **Testing and Documentation**: Employ thorough testing strategies, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI for API documentation to facilitate easy integration for frontend teams and external systems.

- **Deployment**: Consider containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes for scalable and manageable deployment. Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment processes.

The User Management Service plays a foundational role in the system's architecture, underpinning the security and personalized experience of the MAG flying club's booking system. Its design and implementation should prioritize security, scalability, and a seamless user experience.

### OAUTH 2.0
Spring Security 5 introduced first-class support for OAuth 2.0 Login, simplifying the integration of third-party authentication providers.
